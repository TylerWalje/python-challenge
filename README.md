Hi there. My name is Tyler Walje and this is my Data Visualization project. Please reach out with any questions to walje15@gmail.com or (720) 937-7927.
Thank you.

## Python Challenge Notes
1. Each script is located within the appropriate folders, along with the Analysis (with results in a .txt file) and the Resources (csv file).
2. For PyBank, I used a string to output the solution to the .txt file. For PyPoll, I used print statements. I found each solution to work the best for each dataset (or at least the way I approached it).

Thank you.
